# A.L.I.E.N
###### A Little Interface (for) Easy Networking

##### The A.L.I.E.N. Client/Server classes demonstrate how to implement basic TCP/IP Networking (Internet) functionality in C++ apps built using the QT Framework. The Botan cryptographic library is also included, leaving everything except for the essential networking code, up to the developer.

* Programming Language(s)
  * C++

* Frameworks
  * [QT 5.10.0](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.10/5.10.0/) (recommended QT 5.x)
  * [Botan 2.0.1](https://botan.randombit.net/)
  
* Requirements
  * A basic understanding of TCP/IP Networking and/or Sockets, however minimal
