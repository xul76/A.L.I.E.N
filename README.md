# A.L.I.E.N
###### A Little Interface (for) Easy Networking

The A.L.I.E.N. Client and Server classes demonstrate how to implement TCP/IP Networking (Internet) functionality in C++ apps built using the QT Framework.

It serves as a learning tool for new C++ and/or QT developers to learn how networking functionality is implemented manually, but also as a ready-to-use set of classes that you can use right away from QT.

The Botan cryptographic library is also included, leaving everything except for the essential networking code up to you, the developer.
