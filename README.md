# A.L.I.E.N.
###### A Little Interface (for) Easy Networking

* Programming Language(s)
  * C++

* Frameworks
  * QT 5.10.0
  
* Requirements
  * A minimal understanding of TCP/IP Networking
  
The A.L.I.E.N. Project is a set of two QT/C++ classes which conveniently add TCP/IP or Internet functionality to your app.

It is meant as an example for those interested in developing their own Network/Internet-based apps. Only the essential
components of establishing, managing and interacting with Network Sockets are included in A.L.I.E.N. and as such it is a case
example for developers that only covers the most essential theory for 

# A.L.I.E.N. Server
###### The server-side component

The low-level mechanics of dealing with TCP/IP fundamentals are handled by A.L.I.E.N. and QT. 

Both the Server- and Client components are well-commented and further documentation is still in preparation.
