# A.L.I.E.N
###### A Little Interface (for) Easy Networking

##### The A.L.I.E.N. Client and Server classes demonstrate how to implement TCP/IP Networking (Internet) functionality in C++ apps built using the QT Framework. It serves as a learning tool for new C++ and/or QT developers to learn how networking functionality is implemented manually, but also as a ready-to-use set of classes that you can use right away from QT.
