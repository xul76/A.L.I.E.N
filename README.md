###### The A.L.I.E.N. Project demonstrates how to implement TCP/IP Networking (Internet) functionality in your QT apps.

The low-level
mechanics of dealing with the connections are handled by A.L.I.E.N. and a high-level interface is provided for developers to

It is primarily meant as an example for those interested in developing their own Network/Internet-based apps. Only the
