The A.L.I.E.N. Project is a set of two QT/C++ classes which conveniently add TCP/IP or Internet functionality to your app.
Your app can be turned into a server- or client type program in no-time and the complicated components of Internet-based app
development are thus abstracted from the dev process.

It consists of two components:

- A.L.I.E.N Server
  - Allows other apps and devices to connect to your app over the Local Network (LAN) or Internet (WAN)

- A.L.I.E.N Client
  - Allows your app to connect to other apps and devices over the LAN or WAN

The low-level mechanics of dealing with TCP/IP fundamentals are handled by A.L.I.E.N. and QT. It is meant as an example case
for those interested in developing their own Network/Internet-based apps, but with slight modifications, it could be deployed
for practical purposes as well.

Both the Server- and Client components are well-commented and further documentation is still in preparation.
